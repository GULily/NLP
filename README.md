LDA_LSA_tfidf.ipynb 

- I used the TF-IDF weights to calculate the cosine similarities between different documents. 

- I used the LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) and LSI (latent semantic index)/LSA to do topic modeling. 

- Conclusion is that in this case, the method of LDA is the best, the method of LSA is in the middle, and the method of TF-IDF is the worst.
